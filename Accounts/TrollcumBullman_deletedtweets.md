Have a solid think about that.

If you are organising correctly then you are organising with a lot of marginalised people, and they need to know they can trust you to be super concerned about their safety.  This is the opposite of that and its gross.

Why should anyone trust you enough to organise with you if you're going to sacrifice their abuse concerns at the altar of your ego.
