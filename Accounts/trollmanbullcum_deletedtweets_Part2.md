To be clear, in your extremely adept political mind, this only happens if it's spelled out in a press quote?

The line was never advertised as a mental health helpline, nor that immediate/timely resonse was guaranteed. It was for people to call up about their centrelink payments.  That you are so mad about the volunteer org

Not because of the crushing poverty of the welfare system or the total lack of support for mental health in medicare (something Labor had 6 years to fix and fucked up completely).  Dumbass

It of course started with him being a total deadshit about the AUWU.  This guy sucks so much and it's so satisfying to let ASIC and the ATO know that he's back on his bullshit.

I also don't at all believe you because you're not even registered for the GST. You are clearly once again dodging your obligations. Scum

Full name, websites, email addresses etc  You have clearly attempted to rip off their branding because you're a huckster. Which is why you were struck off for dodging obligations. Fuck you are shit

Submitting tipoffs now.  Thank you for revealing yourself to be a wage-thieving, tax-dodging rent-seeker.  Very cool
