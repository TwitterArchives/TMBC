The IPCC reports tell us we have 12 years to go to zero emissions and the ALP wants to do it by 2050.  We can't keep living in this fantasy that "less wrong" is good enough. It isn't.

They signed the death warrant on the union movement. There are record low strike actions despite record high wage theft.  They're captured, Chris. Sorry to break it to you.

Union membership has fallen from nearly 50% before the Accords to now a paltry 15%  The ACTU is a totally captured arm of the ALP serving corporate masters. It's a fucking sick joke.

It's pure self-interest from the top brass. And you just can't wait to line up and lick their boots.

The ALP banned tobacco donations in 2004 then won power in 2007. Big Tobacco was powerless to do anything because their policy set around that was very positive and empowering to the community.

You're also going to have to explain that logic champ. How do you go from one of the two majros refusing to be captured by fossil fuel donations

Cameron Milner is getting paid huge by Adani. What are you getting out of it?

He'll keep his networks in the ALP and make an enormous profit personally by capturing poiicy for fossil fuel interests.  The party is totally captured and can't be trusted as far as they can be thrown

Didn't raise NewStart while in power, shunted single parents onto it. Didn't put dental into medicare. Didn't do anything about ballooning out-of-pocket specialist costs.  Blind loyalty to a party gets you that. They take it for granted.

Maybe you should stop stanning them and actually try holding them to account instead of conducting 'interviews' where you just eyefuck them for hours at a time.

You brought up Elizabeth Warren as "not a faithful servant of capital" when there's a now infamous quote about her declaring her love for capitalism.  I have no idea what point you're trying to make.

I ended up at Bialik after Scopus.  There was a single kashrut-observant person in the whole year level.  You better believe I got reported for putting a ham-and-cheese sandwich in (one) of the FOUR VCE common room toasters.

It still really fucking weirds me out how many descendents of Holocaust survivors didn't turn out left-wing.  It seemed almost like a corollary to me. But in fact, the reality was the opposite.  Still makes no sense.

It's baked into the love and relationships I had with so many people from my formative years.  But when I think of the rainbow future I dream of, I'm not sure ideologically that I want to retain a close-knit community based on ethnicity.

The centrists with brain worms who think they're lefitsts because they don't want to do a pogrom on the Muslims but also think it's very cool to host Daniel fucking Pipes for guest lectures.  Sorry I could go on about this forever.

I'm basically done with the community. I honour my family's sacrifice in the Holocaust by being a good leftist. Never again for anyone means Solidarity Forever.  To me, that's being my best Jewish self.

That's you burying your head in the sand and crying "LALALA I CAN'T HEAR THEM COS THEY'RE COMMUNISTS"  Because there's sludge where your brain should be.

Cos I'm looking at the graph of union membership and seeing the steep decline begin directly at the accords.  Your thesis about other countries matches the fact they enacted similar policies

Except that union membership and its efficacy has been on a massive downward trend since the purge you allude to.  Your brain is sludge, Pisscull.

I'd like to bring to your attention  @Kynes99  recent transphobia, in which he partook with his friends  @revardin  and  @CmdrKelvan . It is absolutely gross. Hope you'll reconsider association with him. Thread here: https://twitter.com/TrollmanBullcum/status/1261666811218546689

That's how you justify to yourself that it's normal behaviour. You creepy weirdo.
