The capitalist class are people who extract surplus from workers to accumulate large surpluses of capital.  It comprises anyone who does those things.

I do doubt the causal link between that happening and any material change on the system. At best, capital would find a different capture mechanism.

Journos are paypigs because capital has the resources to reward paypigs.  The principled good journalists end up deplatformed and broke, while the shills get WaPo editorial gigs.

That the problem with capitalism and markets is that the "bad corrupt" people are running capitalism. We just need better masters!   It misses the dimension that a system that rewards profit for its own sake will inevitably be corrupt. https://twitter.com/sallyrugg/status/1359674750209912836
